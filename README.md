This repository contains Finite Volume Method code for solving hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) using Rusanov's flux.  
Two test equation have been solved:  
- Linear Advection Equation
- Euler Equation (under maintenance)

The goal for this repository is to develop code for serial and parallel implementation of Finite Volume Method for both the above equations. The parallel part is yet to be done using MPI.
